# Memorize Lists While you Walk

Cicero used to train his students of oratory to memorize their speeches by the "Method of Loci," nowadays known as a Memory Palace. The idea is to take some sequence of things you can visualize easily and reliably, then associate the Items-To-Memorize (ITMs) to that sequence. Cicero taught his students to picture locations, or "loci," along a route they walk daily, say from the bedroom to the bathroom to the kitchen to the garden to the local market, and so on. He knew that most of his students could recall dozens, if not hundreds, of loci, in sequence, with little effort. 

Nowadays, we drive to most places and, hopefully, pay more attention to the traffic than to the scenery. Hundreds of "loci" are more difficult to come by, at least for me. But that doesn't mean the method is out of date, it just means we need some other sequence of mental images to hang our ITMs on. Voila --- the pegs from my earlier blog [PEGS-TO-PAO](https://rebcabin.github.io/TheBigBlog/2025/11/08/pegs-to-pao.html). Ok, that's only ten loci, but I promised we'll work that up to 100 (actually 110). For now, let's see how we can use pegs to make a small Memory Palace for a short shopping list. We'll freely use images from PAO to assist recall, but we won't use the person-action-object grammar for sequencing, just the pegs.

We're getting ready to go off to work and our spouse shouts out a shopping list. We won't have time to shop until AFTER a grueling day of mentally exhausting work, so somehow we've got to capture the list. We're scrounging for keys and glasses and badge and other stuff we need for work, and we're running late and don't have time to write it down or thumb it into our phone. The only option left is to memorize it, on the fly. 

> "Grapes, seedless red," she shouts. 

Peg 1 is "tea," so we picture the giant Disneyland teacups filled with red grapes, and they're spilling out and getting crushed and making a red-wine-colored mess. 

> "Green onions, two bunches," she shouts. 

Peg 2 is "Noah." Picture him shaking two bunches of green onions, one in each hand, as he counts the animals going up into the ark, two-by-two. 

> "A head of lettuce," she shouts. 

Peg 3 is "me," and here I am, looking at myself in the mirror with a head of lettuce instead of my real head. 

> "A block of cheddar, if it's on sale" comes the next order. 

Luke Skywalker, peg 4, is carving up a floating cheese block with his light saber; the block is floating with a discount sign on it. 

> "Dozen jumbo eggs." 

A jumbo cop is holding up his five-fingered hand with a box of eggs in the other hand. 

> "Coffee." 

Lurch is tearing open a can of coffee with his teeth in his lantern jaw. 

> "Graham crackers." 

Alladin is twisting his key into a box of Graham crackers. 

> "Loaf of wheat bread, but only if it's less than 4 bucks." 

My lawyer is counting out four gold pieces on his desk next to the loaf of wheat. 

> "A can of peas!" 

Ok, I'm cheating on this one: peg 9 is "pea." Just thought I'd give you a freebie.

The first time you do this, you might have to go over the list in your mind a couple of times. But you should be able to recall it at the end of the work day without difficulty. 

Now, quick, without looking up, what's item #3? Item #7? Recite items #6, #5, #4 in that order. I bet you could do all that.

True story: I once taught this to a room full of administrative assistants in the following way. I told them that ***I would memorize the list*** that they would shout out. As they shouted out each item, I described the peg for that item, its rationale and mnemonic, and finally the mental picture I concocted to remember the item. At the end of the memorizing part, I then told them "I'm not going to recall the list for you, ***you are***." I then pointed to one student and asked "What's item #3?" To another and "what's item #7?" To another and "what are items #6, #5, and #4, in that order." Of course, they all could do it. They had memorized the list _despite themselves_. 

Point made: this method is nearly foolproof and beginners can get it in one lesson.
