# Foundations of a Trained Memory

All the time, I hear people complain that they don't have a great memory,
especially for names and numbers. What if I told you that _anyone_ can
_develop_ a great memory, for names, for numbers, for lists, speeches, talks,
scripts, whatever? 

Almost everyone has a pretty good visual memory. You can probably remember
characters from movies, perhaps Luke Skywalker or Bilbo Baggins. You certainly
remember cameos and vignettes from your past: your mom, a birthday party, a
wedding, a day at the park. In fact, you know hundreds or thousands of such
things and you can recall them without effort. This recall is so effortless, it
even happens while you're asleep, in your dreams.

The secret of a trained memory is to trick your mind into associating things
that are hard to remember, like names and numbers, to things that are easy to
remember: vivd mental images.  Here's an example: an acquaintance of mine,
Mike, big handsome guy, is a military chaplain and a motorcycle rider. When I
see him, he is usually wearing his motorcycle leather jacket. I immediately
picture him riding his Harley and shouting a sermon through the wind into a
microphone mounted on his motorcycle. A "mike on his bike." This comes so fast
that I can say "Hey, Mike! How's it going" before he greets me (he probably
doesn't remember my name)! When I first met him, I made sure to invent this
association and drill it enough times that I'll never forget it.

How about numbers? Right now, I'm going to teach you an ancient method that
will let you remember numbers without writing them down. This method is
thousands of years old, from a time when writing was too expensive or
cumbersome for common folk. They had to develop great memories just to survive!
Nowadays, we lean on our phones to remember things, but what if you forgot your
phone? What if its battery ran out?

If you stick with me for more blogs, I will show you how to expand this to
remember part numbers on numbered invoices, scientific information like the
periodic table, secure passwords, shopping lists and shipping manifests,
shuffled card packs, speeches, whatever, whenever you want. And you can
remember them without hauling out your phone!

Today, we'll memorize a (fake) phone number for my lawyer, 285-409-5768. Here
is my "metal movie" for it: 

285 --- Noah (from the Bible) is hoarding SUVs (my lawyer drives a Range Rover)

409 --- My lawyer is watching Luke Skywalker sawing, with his light saber, a
princess in two, as in the old magic trick

576 --- A cop is twisting thorny rose stems into a "gift" for ...

8 --- My lawyer

If you "buy" this association, when you think of your lawyer, you'll mentally
picture his Range Rover and remember all the rest. Ok, so the visuals are easy
to remember, but, how did you come up with them, and how are you going to back
them out into the phone number?

It's all because you memorized, say by old-fashioned brute force, the
following _permanent_ list of associations:

| Number | Peg (Sound) | Visual Mnemonic                   | PAO (Person-Action-Object)                              |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | saw         | both are round                    | lumberjacks sawing a log                                |
| 1      | tea         | look-alikes                       | Miss Marple pouring tea                                 |
| 2      | Noah        | two “legs” in “N”                 | Noah counting animals two-by-two                        |
| 3      | me          | three “legs” in “M”               | me tying a bow tie in the mirror                        |
| 4      | ray         | “4” is backwards “r”              | Luke Skywalker flourishing his light saber              |
| 5      | law         | cop holds up a five-fingered hand | cop stopping an SUV                                     |
| 6      | jaw         | a lantern jaw looks like “6”      | Lurch from the Addams family chewing thorny rose stems  |
| 7      | key         | an Allen key looks like “7”       | Alladin twisting a key in the door to the treasure room |
| 8      | fee         | “8” looks like a dollar sign      | my lawyer hoarding a pile of gold                       |
| 9      | pea         | “9” is backwards “P”              | a pea bruising a princess through nine mattresses       |

Now you can see the reason for the title of this post, "Pegs to PAO."

Here is the full construction: 

285 --- Noah (person of 2), Hoarding (action of 8), SUVs (object of 5)

409 --- Luke Skywalker (person of 4), Sawing (action of 0), Princess (object of 9)

576 --- Cop (Person of 5), Twisting (action of 7), Thorny Stems (object of 6)

8 --- Lawyer (person of 8)

By the way, the PAO column is my personal one, fitting my personal visual
memory. Feel free to make up your own PAO column if mine doesn't fit your
personal visual memory. But don't change the first three columns; they're part
of the ancient, proven system, known to millions. Once you have arrived at the
table that works for you, pound it into your memory any way you can, never
forget it, and practice it frequently, say when you're trying to fall asleep.
Meditate on it if that's your thing. Make it so natural and so permanent that
going from numbers to consonant sounds (pegs) and visualizations (PAO) is
instantaneous.

You can now memorize numbers in groups of three. Later, when we expand to pegs
through 99, you can memorize numbers in groups of SIX! We'll also turn pegs
into a "Memory Palace," letting us memorize lists and speeches and more. 

Finally, remember this is an ancient and proven method. I didn't make it up, I
just adapted the PAO to my personal visual memory. Stick with me, and you might
even become a memory champion! Yes, there are timed memory competitions wherein
athletes memorize stacks of playing cards, lists of thousands of unrelated
words or digits, and more. For the rest of us, we will be empowered to forget
our phones and still call our lawyer!
